## Introduction

Welcome to **Project Admin Dashboard**! I built this website to demonstrate knowledge working in React JS and accessing API endpoints. This website was built using React JS and is hosted on Firebase. The Dashboard Layout is a grid structured layout control, that helps to create a dashboard with panels. Panels hold the UI components or data to be visualized with flexible options like resize, reorder, drag-n-drop, remove and add, that allows users to easily place the panels at a desired position within the grid layout. This website was built using the Syncfusion API.
